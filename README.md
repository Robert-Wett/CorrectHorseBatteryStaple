####A simple webapp that gives you a randomized password based on the famous [xkcd](http://xkcd.com) comic:   

![number 936](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png)  

####Features:
 - Create a strong password completely client-side.
 - Provide options for:
     - Number of words to use
     - Adding personal words to incorporate into the result
 - Everything will be done client-side, so there's no chance of data persistance
####Stack:
 - Node + angular
     -  Python really is awesome for the back-end lifting, though this is pretty simple stuff. To be honest, this is the first time I've experimented with Node.js as a command line tool to accomplish the base functionality. Not too bad.
